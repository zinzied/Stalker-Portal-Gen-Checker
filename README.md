This Python application is a Stalker Portal MAC address generator and checker. It generates MAC addresses, checks them against a specified Stalker Portal, and retrieves information such as the number of channels and expiry date. The application is built using PyQt5 for the GUI and leverages threading for concurrent processing.

## Features

- Generate MAC addresses starting from a specified address.
- Check MAC addresses against a Stalker Portal.
- Retrieve and display information such as the number of channels and expiry date.
- Save results to a text file.
- Simple and intuitive GUI built with PyQt5.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- Requests
- Cryptography

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
